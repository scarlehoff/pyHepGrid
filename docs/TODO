- Send production as subjobs for arc [if possible]

- Warmup and dat files in ARC/DIRAC sandbox - if job fails halfway through you can retrieve output... Alternatively, find whether there is a "backup" system so that we can copy the files somewhere else. It might also be a problem with lfc-ls?...

- Make the script gfal ready...

- Option to do arcsync from main.py so that it queries the database and we only do arcsync for jobs and CEs that are actually being used.

- Support for passing multiple runcards for initialisation/submission at once (requires modules reloading for runcard.py overrides)

- Play around with priority systems for get_site_info.py hooks

- Runcard test function which takes the setup to be initialised and check it runs ok
