- Send production as subjobs for arc [if possible]

- Warmup and dat files in ARC/DIRAC sandbox - if job fails halfway through you can retrieve output... Alternatively, find whether there is a "backup" system so that we can copy the files somewhere else. It might also be a problem with lfc-ls?...

- When printing a multijob in arc, don't print jobs which have a -1 in the database! 

- Use this information in the retrieval script so we don't query jobs that are not finished. Make this "conservative" feature to be an extra option so the default behavoir do not change

- Make the script gfal ready...
